# Telemetry in Mitosheet

We don't log any of your private data, but we do collect telemetry information about button clicks, where Mito is loaded from, and other general interactions with the app. 

If you want to turn off telemetry, you can purchase a Pro account on our [plans page](https://trymito.io/plans). This will also get you access to a variety of other pro features like graph styling, generated code optimization, export formating, and many more coming soon!

## What information is logged?

We aim to be very transparent about the information we collect in our telemetry. You can see a complete enumeration of all the events we log in the `private_params_map.py` file in this folder. 

## How do you anonymize data?

You can see the functions for logging
