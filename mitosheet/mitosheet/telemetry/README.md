# Telemetry in Mitosheet

We don't log any of your private data, but we do collect telemetry information about button clicks, where Mito is loaded from, and other general interactions with the app. 

If you want to turn off telemetry, you can purchase a Pro account on our [plans page](https://trymito.io/plans). This will also get you access to a variety of other pro features like graph styling, generated code optimization, export formating, and many more coming soon!
