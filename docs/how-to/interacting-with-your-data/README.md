# Using Spreadsheet Formulas

Once you've imported your data into Mito, you can think about interacting with Mito in a similar way to Google Sheets or Excel.&#x20;

## Writing Spreadsheet Formulas&#x20;

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/d5ybBvey7mk" %}



Mito supports writing spreadsheet formulas to clean and transform your data. You can see a full list of formulas in Mito by clicking on the **Documentation Button**, the question mark button in the Mito toolbar or by checking out [Mito Spreadsheet Formulas](mito-spreadsheet-formulas.md).&#x20;

To write a formula, use the **Add Column** button in the Mito toolbar, and write a formula in the cell or use the formula bar just like you would in Excel.&#x20;
